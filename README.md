# Gene-culture coevolution
> [webpage](https://zoometh.github.io/aDNA/)

It is quite clear how our present is shaped by the recent Prehistory.
Today, most of our present socio-economic politics are grounded on a
Neolithic way of living (demography, production, ownership, residential
mobility, etc.); human images, extremely rare during Paleolithic, spread
during Neolithic times and represent today our main subject of interest;
most of modern Europeans belong to the haplogroup H (ca 40%) inherited
partly from Middle and Late Neolithic migrations; etc. Investigations on
gene-culture coevolution have become a major issue of prehistoric
studies. Until recently, narratives on ancient societies were the
prerogative of archaeologists and prehistorians but the development of
ancient DNA (aDNA), haplogroup (hg) studies, isotopes analysis,
paleoenvironmental and climatic sciences have opened a fertile dialogue
about the recognition of ancient cultures, their interactions, their
environmental adaptation and their evolution. To this day, gene-culture
coevolution studies benefit from a large amount of data and models
yearly renewed or refined (e.g. hg characterizations, climatic models,
radiocarbon calibration curves and dating) stored in databases or in
scientific publications. Prehistory itself has evolved by integrating
these scientific advances and by giving more importance to databases,
statistics and spatial analysis. This situation permits to go further in
the study of forces (genetic, cultural, environmental) that shape our
modern societies. 

To describe gene-culture coevolution, two
global dimensions of social groups can be distinguished: its genetic
identity (['***Who ?***'](https://github.com/zoometh/thomashuet/blob/main/README.md#who)) and its cultural identity (['***What ?***'](https://github.com/zoometh/thomashuet/blob/main/README.md#what))

## Theory

The identity of a social group is the conjunction of its cultural and
genetic identities. In traditional societies, the language barrier and
the cost of transport are the main factors to explain why genetic and
cultural transmissions are mostly vertical (between generations, on the
spot). Over time, autocorrelations appear between genetics, culture and
geography, for example: 

* a new generation inherits its parents' language (mother tongue) as it inherits its genes; two populations are all the
more genetically similar they are geographically close
* the geographical extension of a social group is the area where the association of its genetic and cultural traits is higher than anywhere outside this area
* genetic and cultural distances between social groups will be all the more important as these groups are separated by time and space
* etc. 

The map of present European nations is also the map of their genomic proximities [[1]](#1): there are generally gradual differences (i.e.
linear gradient) between neighboring countries in terms of: genetics, languages, kinship systems, etc. This 'continuity principle' permits to
ground gene-culture coevolution studies on parsimonious models: tendencies (i.e. mean, median, standard deviations) of cultural and genetic traits, [community detetction](https://zoometh.github.io/aDNA/#Community_detection)
population continuity, spatial friction, cultural consensus theories, seriations, etc. Exceptions to this 'continuity principle' are very few.
Maybe the Basque population should be the best example [[2]](#2). Beside the importance of vertical transmission, some horizontal
transmissions could have been major triggers of social changes. In this way, diffusion and adoption of innovations, with its new animal breeds,
vegetal landraces, weaving or ploughing techniques, prestigious goods, etc., are only the most visible. All along the Neolithic, cultural
diffusion and trait-adoptions became increasingly significant, leading to Bronze Age highly hierarchised societies and globalized economy
[[2]](#2). 

For example, last Mesolithic sites are preferentially located
in the mountain -- maybe because of the Neolithic pressure created by
the arrival of first farmers -- while early farming sites occupied
fertile lands: soils of the Balkans flood plains during Painted Pottery
complex (PPC) diffusion, loessic soils of Central Europe and morainic
soils of the Northern Alps during LBK diffusion (id. in the Southern
Alps during Cardial diffusion). Spatial statistics have various indexes
or models able to describe and explain spatial distributions. For
example, we will calculate cost-weighted time of walk buffers from site
locations (site catchment analysis) to study both site environmental
context (site supply, repository of raw materials, land cover and arable
lands, local climate, etc.) and inter-site connections. For traditional
societies, a terrestrial 50/60 km radius, corresponding roughly to a
day's walk, would be a theoretically good threshold below which
principal genetic and cultural traits (marriage, language, economic
exchanges, etc.) are optimal. Map algebra between land cover, slopes,
climatic model, etc., will be used to evaluate the attractiveness of
soils. Spatial statistics (e.g. semi-variograms), indexes (e.g.,
autocorrelation Moran's I, location quotient) or pattern distribution
(e.g. Ripley's K function, Kernel density) will permit to characterize
social groups' spatial distributions [[10]](#10). Geographic models (e.g.
core-periphery, down-the-line, directional trade) will permit to match
past observations with present ones (ethnographic, economic). To reduce
the variability of the dataset, sites will be clustered according to
their own specificities (e.g. category, size) and their inter-relations
(e.g. geographical or network distances, genetic and cultural
differences of their inhabitants). Beside geographical analysis, network
analysis will be performed when qualitative \"connections\" between
\"nodes\" (these terms are contextually-defined) will be observed.

## Case studie: a colonisation

A current model for these diffusion/differentiation processes follows
these three phases:

1.  taking possession of a new territory: founder effect (loss of
    genetic diversity); opposition indigenous/incomers; incomers
    maintain links with their region of origin, perceptible, in
    particular, in common styles and long-distance exchanges;

2.  rooting and withdrawal: contacts with indigenous populations
    increase (admixture); selection of some cultural traits from
    indigenous and incomers backgrounds; contacts with the area of
    origin decrease, styles tends to lean towards regionalization;

3.  development and identity affirmation: a new social group appears;
    styles autonomy; the potential of the new territory is really
    exploited; long-distance exchanges restart;
